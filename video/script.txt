1. Opening (0:00 – 0:15)
Guy sitting alone in college café.

Distant, slow-motion world.

Looking at phone: old pic with her.

Mood: stillness, sadness.

2. Flashbacks – Past Love (Verse 1)
Sweet memories: walking together, eating, basketball fun, laughing, sitting on stairs.

Quick cuts, warm lighting.

No breakup scene — just beautiful moments that feel far away now.

3. Her New Relationship Begins (Mid Verse 1 – Start of Chorus)
Girl with new boy — holding books, laughing, taking selfies.

She looks happy.

Guy watches from a distance — invisible to her.

4. Her Relationship Starts Falling Apart (Verse 2 – Mid Chorus)
New guy starts ignoring her — looks at his phone, walks ahead, shows boredom.

She smiles awkwardly, pretends all is good in front of others.

When alone, her smile fades a little.

She hides sadness from friends.

5. Ex Still Notices Everything (Bridge)
Guy watches from window or corridor — he knows she’s pretending.

He walks alone through places they used to share.


6. Final Climax (Last Chorus – Outro)
Scene: girl standing alone after fight with new guy.

He walks away coldly or gets on his bike and leaves.

She's left alone, just like the guy was.

From far, the ex sees her.

Their eyes meet.

She doesn’t smile.

He doesn't go to her.

7. Ending Scene

She watches him — maybe regret, maybe just silence.

Fade out.
